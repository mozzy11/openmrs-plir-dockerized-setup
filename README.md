## PLIR dockerized setup
This project contains the dockerized setup for the [PLIR](https://wiki.openmrs.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=235278351) project Proof Of Concept.
see [PLIR archtecture](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/projects/Architectural+Design+Approach+to+support+an+integrated+approach+to+patient-level+indicator+reporting+for+OpenMRS)

Ensure you have Docker and Docker compose installed locally.
See Docker Installation Instructions for your environment.  If running on Linux, check https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ to install docker compose.

To run the project , follow the instructions below .
1. Clone the repository locally

        git clone https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-plir-dockerized-setup.git

2. Move to the project root directory and spin up the pre-configured OpenMRS ,OpenHIM ,Hapi-Fhir and the streaming-binlog pipeline instances . 

       ./run.sh

3. You should be able to acces the OpenMRS ,OpenHIM and Hapi-Fhir instances  at the following urls



| Instance  |     URL       | credentials (user : password)|
|---------- |:-------------:|------:                       |
| OpenMRS   |  http://localhost:8080/openmrs  | admin : Admin123 |
| OpenHIM   |    http://localhost:9000  |  root@openhim.org : openhim-password |
| Hapi FHir | http://localhost:8090 |    hapi : hapi123| 


   Note:
 * The OpenMRS Instance is pre-loaded with CIEL and a  sample form (HIV_form) to collect TX_PVLS specific data

 * The above script also loads the necesary TX_PVLS Measure and Library Resources into the Hapi FHir . see the Resources under the `resources` folder.

 * The Openhim instance is pre-configured with the necesary meta-data

  > Wait for the **plir-streaming-pipeline** container to start running before adding any data into OpenMRS. The running Pipeline will then listen to any  data changes  added in to OpenMRS and route them to the FHIR server through OpenHIM.

   

  4. Invoke the **collect-data** FHIR Operation using the GET request below to generate the relevant Dataset for TX_PVLS


          GET: http://localhost:8090/fhir/Measure/TX-PVLS/$collect-data?periodStart=<date>&periodEnd=<date>
   

  5. Invoke the  **evaluate-measure** FHIR Operation using the GET request below for the  indicator calculation based on CQL evaluation

         GET: http://localhost:8090/fhir/Measure/TX-PVLS/$evaluate-measure?periodStart=<date>&periodEnd=<date> 
         
  > Note : substitute `<date>` in the GET request with your actual date parameter  .  

   6. You can use the plir-widget to easily query and  visualise the Measure report generated from the HAPI-FHIR server .see widget source code under `plir-widget/widget-source`
   
* install the [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)  .
 see inginix (proxy-server) config under  `plir-widget/config/nginx.conf`  . 
* To run the widget , run the command below from the root directory



          ./run-widget.sh  


 * you should be able to access the widget at `http://localhost:7000/` .

>  Procede to select the measure  TX-PVLS ,
      select the start date and generate the report using the widget
      


 7. To remove and clean out all created containers and volumes, run

          ./stop.sh

 ## Auto Regenerating the TX_PVLS Library resource    
 In case changes have been made to the Library cql logic at  `resources/cql_logic.txt`  , the  TX_PVLS Library resource  at  `resources/tx_pvls-library.json`  can be auto re-generated .

 * install the [jq](https://linuxhint.com/bash_jq_command/) library 

 * run the command below from the root directory

       ./scripts/regenerate-library.sh
  > The above script encodes the cql logic into Base64 format and rebuilds the TX_PVLS Library  

## AUTOMATED PLIR TESTING 
We use the [hie-automation-tests](https://github.com/CDCgov/hie-automation-tests) framework to test the PLIR pipeline work flow . 

Clone the  [extended hie-automation-tests](https://github.com/openmrs/hie-automation-tests) framework that Supports Testing PLIR workflow.

    git clone https://github.com/openmrs/hie-automation-tests.git

see more [details](https://github.com/openmrs/hie-automation-tests/blob/master/PLIR-TEST.md) 
### Prerequisites

* Python version >= 3.7
* Behave version >= 1.2
* Debezium-FHIR-Analytics component
* OpenMRS
* OpenHIM 
* HAPI-FHIR

### Configuration 
 
Update the Configuration in the config.json file located under the `features/config` folder . Only OpenMRS , OpenHIM and HapiFHIR are required

NOTE :The deafult  configuration are mapped to the default configuration in the [dockerized PLIR setup](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-plir-dockerized-setup)

See sample observation data Posted to OpenMRS under `features/data` ie `obs1.json ,obs2.json ,obs3.json` .In case any values are adjusted in the above sample data, adjust the expected TX_PVLS score (rounded off to two decimal places) ie TX_PVLS-SCORE in the config file

* The Test will work best before you add any data to OpenMRS

Execute the test with the  command below, under the root directory,but first ensure the PLIR pipeline is up and running.

	behave --no-logcapture --include ./features/PLIR
 	
The tests will
 * Post Obs data into OpenMRS 
 * Track the transactions in OpenHIM
 * Check whether the correct TX_PVLS indicator measureScore was calculated in HAPI FHIR   


## Main Repositories
